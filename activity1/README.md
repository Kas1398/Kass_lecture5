# Activities

## Task 1

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how the
  Recursive Factorial works:
  https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RecFact.html

  Answer:
    - The algorithm takes an integer n as an input.
     It checks if n is equal to 0 or 1. If so, it returns 1 since 0! and 1! are both equal to 1.
     If n is greater than 1, the algorithm calculates the factorial of n-1 recursively by calling itself with the input value of (n-1).
    The result of the recursive call is then multiplied by n to get the factorial of n.

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how the Recursive Fibonacci works:

## Task 2

There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. There is a simple implementations in `./src/` folder. Discuss how the code works.

## Task 3

- There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs or **3 stairs** at a time. Write a program that counts the number of ways, the person can reach the top. You can use the following program as a starter `./src/staircase1.cpp`. Also the link below might useful:

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- What are the pros/cons of recursive over iterative Programming?
- Difference between recursion and induction.
