# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the following link. Explain how the Knapsack Algorithm works:
https://monicagranbois.com/knapsack-algorithm-visualization/

Ans:
    - The Knapsack Algorithm works by breaking down a complex problem into smaller subproblems and building a table to keep track of the optimal solutions. By filling in the table row by row, the algorithm can determine the maximum value that can be achieved while staying within the weight capacity of the knapsack.

## Task 2

Refer to the following link. What are the difference between the brute force and the optimized solutions to the Knapsack problem.
https://www.educative.io/blog/0-1-knapsack-problem-dynamic-solution

Ans:
    - The main difference between the brute force and optimized solutions to the Knapsack problem is their time complexity. The brute force approach is straightforward but inefficient, while the optimized approach requires more complex algorithms but can provide faster solutions. Therefore, the optimized approach is preferred for large Knapsack problems where the brute force approach is impractical.

## Task 3

There are different implementations of the stair case problem in the following link:

Compare the time and space complexity of the different approaches

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Difference between divide and conquer and dynamic programming

Ans:
    - The main difference between divide and conquer and dynamic programming is the way they solve subproblems. 
    Divide and conquer solves each subproblem independently, while dynamic programming solves each subproblem only once and stores the intermediate results. Divide and conquer is generally used when subproblems are not overlapping, while dynamic programming is used when subproblems are overlapping. In addition, dynamic programming is usually more space-efficient than divide and conquer as it stores intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. However, divide and conquer can be more efficient than dynamic programming in certain cases where the subproblems are not overlapping and can be solved independently.

- State some application of dynamic programming
Ans:
    - Dynamic programming is a widely used algorithmic technique that is used to solve many real-world problems efficiently. Here are some applications of dynamic programming: 
            Fibonacci series
            Knapsack problem
            Shortest path problem
            Edit distance problem

- Difference between recursion vs dynamic programming

Ans:
    - Recursion is useful for solving problems that can be broken down into identical subproblems, while dynamic programming is useful for solving problems that can be broken down into overlapping subproblems. Dynamic programming can be more efficient in terms of time and space complexity than recursion, especially for problems that involve a large number of subproblems.

- Difference between Top down and bottom up approaches to dynamic programming

Ans:
    - The choice between top-down and bottom-up approach depends on the problem and the available resources. For problems that can be divided into small overlapping subproblems, the top-down approach may be more appropriate, while for problems with independent subproblems, the bottom-up approach may be more efficient.

- How to solve a Dynamic Programming Problem?

Ans:
    - Steps to solve a Dynamic programming problem:
        Identify if it is a Dynamic programming problem.
        Decide a state expression with the Least parameters.
        Formulate state and transition relationship.
        Do tabulation (or memorization).
